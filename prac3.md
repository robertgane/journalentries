<h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>
<p>This week we did a round robin style interview amongst those in our class to find good team members.</p>
<p>https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015/welcome?u=2223545</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>I spent roughly 3 hours this week</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>I learnt how to build my first website and how to use child themes customize it to the liking of myself or the customer. In the practical my questions for the round robin styled interviews were: </p>
<p>What strengths do you bring to a team? I got resposes such as: Being a good communicator, Having skills in particular areas in regards to a project, and aiming for high marks by following rubriks and making sure everything is completed on time</p>
<p>Do you work better solo or in a team? Some people said solo whereas some people said in a team, this i can understand as I found before I found i worked better solo because I wasnt good with working in a team, but now I have shifted and find working in a team easier and better for outputing information when we brainstorm together</p>
<p>How do you allocate your time? The people I interviewed had different answers as they each had a way that they managed their time, for instance writing dates in a dairy, using apps like the calender app and reminders.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>The linkedin videos this week is beneficial as I now know how to make a wordpress website more customizable towards the clients needs in a workplace. Doing the mock interviews for finding our team members in this weeks practical helps me understand what an employer may ask during an interview and what they will be looking.</p>
